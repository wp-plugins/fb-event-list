You must have a Facebook developer account with an application ID and application secret. To request one, please visit [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/apps "Facebook developer site") 

To use the plugin, simply include the short-code [fb_event_list appid="" appsecret="" pageid=""] in a post or page. 

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
